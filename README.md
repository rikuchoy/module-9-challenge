## Project Description

My project is a ReadMe generator. It allows users to easily generate a ReadMe file for their projects through the terminal without worrying about markdown syntax.

I created this project because I wanted a way to streamline the ReadMe-writing process.

As the user, you simply run the code in a terminal and answer the given prompts.

## Installation

First, begin by cloning this repository onto a directory of your choice. Then, open the file in a coding editor and open the terminal. Once the termial is open, ensure that you are in the correct directory. 

## Usage

After installation, run the code in the terminal by first using 'node index.js'. Answer the given prompts until a message 'successfully created' is displayed. You will find the generated ReadMe file within the 'Develop' folder which you can copy and paste into your project.
